A news company requests a data visualisation (dashboard) that will help readers (customers)
understand how countries have performed historically in the summer olympic games (subset of data).

There is an interest in details about competitors so if you find anything interesting then 
dont hesitate to bring that in.

The main task is to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility 
to select your own country. (text slicer)
